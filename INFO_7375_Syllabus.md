## Teaching Assistants
**TBA**  
Students should first contact the TA(s) for programming questions. If unresolved, they will escalate to the professor.

## Learning Assessment
- Quizzes
- Assignments
- Term Projects

## Submission Requirements

All assignments must include:
- A **Jupyter Notebook** (`.ipynb`) file
- A **rendered version** (`.doc` or `.pdf`) of the notebook
- **All member names** must be clearly listed on every submission.
- File naming convention: `LastName_FirstName_Class_AssignmentNumber.zip`
  - For group work, use group name instead of individual name.
- Multiple files must be zipped into a `.zip` file (no `.rar`, `.7z`, `.bz2`).

Assignments must also:
- Estimate the percentage of code written by the student(s) vs. external sources.
- Specify a license at the bottom of each notebook.
- Adhere to a stated coding style guide.

## Canvas Submission Policy
Assignments are submitted via Canvas. Canvas shows raw scores only, not curved or normalized final grades.

## Grading Policies

**Point-Based Grading**
- Point values range from 1 to 1000 per assignment or project.
- Late assignments incur a **5% deduction per day**, rounded up.
- Exams cannot be made up unless arrangements are made beforehand.

**AI-Based Grading Approach**
- Students who score 80% or higher (absolute scale) are graded relative to class:
  - Top 25% → A
  - Next 25% → A-
  - Next 25% → B+
  - Final 25% → B
- Students below 80% are graded by absolute scale:

| Score | Grade |
|:-----|:-----|
| 78–79 | C+ |
| 73–77 | C |
| 70–72 | C- |
| 60–69 | D |
| Below 60 | F |

**Important**: Students below 80% cannot receive higher than B-, even if relative scaling would otherwise suggest a higher grade.

## Participation Policy
Students are expected to engage in discussions and create a supportive learning environment. Report any concerns about the classroom environment to the professor or Dean’s office.

## Collaboration Policies
- Strategy discussions are allowed.
- Final written work and code must be in the student’s own words/style.
- All collaborators must be listed.
- Direct copying without citation is plagiarism and strictly forbidden.
- Violations result in a zero and may be referred to OSCCR.

## Assignment Late Policy
- Assignments are due by **11:59 PM** on the scheduled date.
- 5% per day late penalty.
- No credit given after solutions are posted unless a prior extension is approved via email.
