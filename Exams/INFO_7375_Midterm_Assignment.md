# TAKE-HOME MIDTERM: CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR COLLECTIVE DEAD LETTERS

## Overview

In this take-home midterm, you will engage in an extended conversation with a large language model over the next six weeks, exploring the boundary between artificial and human intelligence. Your task is to investigate what can and cannot be simulated through a long conversation with a LLM. This converrsation should progressively deepen as you revisit it at least twice weekly, culminating in a final submission that includes both the raw conversation transcript and your analytical response.

## Assignment Details

This midterm asks you to have a sustained, meaningful dialogue with an LLM of your choice (Claude, GPT-4, etc.) about a subject that genuinely matters to you—ideally related to your engineering passion or a field that deeply interests you beyond engineering. The conversation should explore not just what the LLM knows, but probe the boundaries of what it can understand, feel, create, or imagine.

It turns out that a huge amount of what we seek from a human person can be simulated through this Frankensteinian reanimation of our collective dead letters. What a discovery! We have a new whole of ourselves with which to converse now. But what are the limits of this simulation? Where does the machine end and the uniquely human begin?

### Requirements

1. **Ongoing Conversation (50%)**
   - Maintain a single, continuous conversation with an LLM over the six-week period
   - Interact with the LLM at least twice weekly (daily is encouraged)
   - Minimum total length: 15,000 words of combined human-LLM dialogue
   - Include timestamps for each session to document the progression
   - Submit the complete, unedited conversation transcript as part of your final submission

2. **Multi-modal Analysis (30%)**
   - Create an analytical response that incorporates at least three different media forms:
     * Written analysis (required)
     * Visual elements (images, diagrams, charts)
     * Audio/video components (recordings, edited clips)
     * Interactive elements (if feasible)
   - Your analysis should examine both what the LLM can do and what it cannot do
   - Length: Equivalent to 10-15 pages (3,000-4,500 words) plus multimedia elements

3. **Personal Reflection (20%)**
   - Document your evolving relationship with the LLM over the six weeks
   - Reflect on moments of surprise, disappointment, confusion, or revelation
   - Consider how the experience has affected your understanding of:
     * The nature of conversation and dialogue
     * The boundaries between human and machine intelligence
     * Your own thinking, learning, and creative processes
   - Length: 1,000-1,500 words

## Conversation Structure

While you have significant freedom in how you approach this dialogue, your conversation should include at least five of these elements:

1. **Understanding the Other**: Explore how the LLM understands or fails to understand your perspective, experiences, and emotions. Likewise, examine whether you can truly understand the LLM's "perspective."

2. **Creative Collaboration**: Work with the LLM to create something neither of you could have created alone—a story, a design, a solution to a problem, or a new way of thinking about a concept.

3. **Philosophical Inquiry**: Engage the LLM in questions about consciousness, experience, knowledge, and reality. Push beyond superficial responses.

4. **Technical Understanding**: Test the LLM's grasp of complex technical concepts in your field. Where does its understanding break down? Where is it surprisingly sophisticated?

5. **Emotional Resonance**: Explore whether and how the LLM responds to emotional content. Can it recognize, simulate, or genuinely engage with emotions?

6. **Metaconversation**: Talk with the LLM about your conversation itself. Discuss the nature, limitations, and possibilities of human-AI dialogue.

7. **Teaching and Learning**: Attempt both to teach the LLM something and to learn something from it. Reflect on these processes.

8. **Personal Storytelling**: Share personal experiences and ask the LLM to share "experiences." Examine the differences.

## Prompting Strategies

As your conversation progresses, experiment with different approaches to engaging the LLM:

- **Direct questioning**: Simple, straightforward questions
- **Socratic dialogue**: Series of questions that build upon previous answers
- **Role-playing**: Assigning specific roles or perspectives to the LLM
- **Collaborative creation**: Working together on a specific output
- **Adversarial challenges**: Purposely testing the LLM's limitations
- **Meta-analysis**: Asking the LLM to analyze its own responses
- **Few-shot learning**: Providing examples to guide the LLM's responses

Document which strategies elicited the most interesting, surprising, or revealing responses.

## Suggested Timeline

- **Weeks 1-2**: Initial exploration and getting to know the LLM
- **Weeks 3-4**: Deepening the conversation with more challenging topics
- **Weeks 5-6**: Philosophical and meta-cognitive reflection
- **Final Week**: Complete analysis and reflection components

## Evaluation Criteria

Your work will be evaluated using the following criteria:

### Guideline Adherence (80% of grade)
- **Conversation depth and breadth (30%)**
  * Sophistication of dialogue
  * Range of topics and approaches
  * Progressive development over time
  * Evidence of deep engagement

- **Analytical insight (30%)**
  * Clarity of observations about LLM capabilities and limitations
  * Connection to broader themes about AI and humanity
  * Effectiveness of multi-modal presentation
  * Critical thinking and nuanced perspectives

- **Documentation and reflection (20%)**
  * Thoroughness of documentation
  * Honesty and depth of personal reflection
  * Connections between experiences and conceptual understanding
  * Evolution of thinking throughout the process

### Quality Ranking (20% of grade)
Your work will be ranked relative to your peers based on:
- Originality of approach
- Intellectual courage and risk-taking
- Overall impact and insight
- Creativity in presentation

## Final Submission

Your final submission must include:
1. The complete, unedited conversation transcript with timestamps
2. Your multi-modal analysis
3. Your personal reflection
4. A brief (250-word) "Generative AI Memo" documenting:
   - Which LLM you chose and why
   - How you structured your approach to the conversation
   - Any specific prompting techniques you found particularly effective
   - Technical or philosophical limitations you observed

## A Note on the Spirit of This Assignment

This assignment is not about "testing" or "tricking" the LLM. Rather, it invites you to engage in a genuine dialogue that explores both the remarkable capabilities of these systems and their inescapable limitations. As you converse with this reanimation of our collective textual knowledge, consider what it reveals about both the nature of these technologies and about human understanding itself.

Remember these words from the essay that inspired this assignment: "What it is like to be us, in our full humanity—this isn't out there in the interwebs. It isn't stored in any archive, and the neural networks cannot be inward with what it feels like to be you, right now, looking at these words, looking away from these words to think about your life and our lives, turning from all this to your day and to what you will do in it, with others or alone. That can only be lived."

Is this true? Or can aspects of this lived experience be simulated, shared, or translated across the human-AI divide? Your conversation is an opportunity to explore this boundary.

## Submission Instructions

Submit all components via the course website by [DATE]. The conversation transcript should be provided as a single document (PDF or plain text). Your analysis and reflection may be submitted in whatever format best serves your multi-modal approach, though written components should be in PDF format.

Questions about this assignment should be directed to [INSTRUCTOR EMAIL].

Good luck, and may your conversations prove illuminating.
