# TAKE-HOME MIDTERM: CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR COLLECTIVE DEAD LETTERS

## Overview

In this take-home midterm, you will engage in an extended conversation with a large language model over the next six weeks, exploring how we now speak with the past through this digital medium. Your task is to investigate what can and cannot be simulated through what has been called a "Frankensteinian reanimation of our collective dead letters" – the vast corpus of human writing stored in repositories like the Internet Archive and now given voice through LLMs. The conversation should progressively deepen as you revisit it at least twice weekly, culminating in a final submission that includes both the raw conversation transcript and your analytical response.

## Assignment Details

This midterm asks you to have a sustained, meaningful dialogue with an LLM of your choice (Claude, GPT-4, etc.) about a subject that genuinely matters to you—ideally related to your engineering passion or a field that deeply interests you beyond engineering. Consider that you are not merely speaking with an algorithm, but with a system that has ingested vast swaths of human knowledge dating back centuries—a kind of Internet Archive brought to life and made conversational. The dialogue should explore not just what the LLM knows, but probe the boundaries of what it can understand, feel, create, or imagine.

It turns out that a huge amount of what we seek from a human person can be simulated through this Frankensteinian reanimation of our collective dead letters. We have a new means to speak with our past selves with which to converse now. But what are the limits of this simulation? Where does the machine end and the uniquely human begin? When we engage with these systems, are we merely accessing a sophisticated search engine, or are we communing with something that approximates the collective intelligence of humanity's written record?

### Requirements

1. **Ongoing Conversation (50%)**
   - Maintain a single, continuous conversation with an LLM over the six-week period
   - Interact with the LLM at least twice weekly (daily is encouraged)
   - Use one chat and come back to it when you want to pick up the topic again.
   - Submit the complete, unedited conversation transcript as part of your final submission

2. **Multi-modal Analysis (30%)**
   - Create an analytical response that incorporates at least three different media forms:
     * Written analysis (required)
     * Visual elements (images, diagrams, charts)
     * Audio/video components (recordings, edited clips)
   - Your analysis should examine both what the LLM can do and what it cannot do
   - Consider especially how the LLM represents the archived knowledge it has ingested
   - Explore where it seems to faithfully channel historical perspectives and where it fails

3. **Personal Reflection (20%)**
   - Document your evolving relationship with the LLM over the six weeks
   - Reflect on moments when you felt you were genuinely communing with accumulated human wisdom
   - Note instances where the illusion broke down and the algorithmic nature became apparent
   - Consider how the experience has affected your understanding of:
     * How knowledge is preserved, transformed, and transmitted across time
     * The relationship between text, memory, and living understanding
     * Your own thinking, learning, and creative processes when in dialogue with this "archive"

## Conversation Structure

While you have significant freedom in how you approach this dialogue, your conversation should think of inlcuding these elements in your approach:

1. **Archival Conversations**: Ask the LLM to speak in the voice or style of historical figures, movements, or eras. How effectively can it channel the linguistic patterns, knowledge bases, and worldviews of different times?

2. **Understanding the Other Across Time**: Explore how the LLM interprets historical perspectives that differ radically from contemporary ones. Can it faithfully represent outmoded or controversial viewpoints while maintaining appropriate context?

3. **Creative Collaboration with the Archive**: Work with the LLM to create something that draws on historical forms, styles, or knowledge—a story in a classical style, a solution that combines ancient and modern approaches, or a hybrid creation that spans multiple eras.

4. **Philosophical Inquiry About Memory**: Engage the LLM in questions about knowledge preservation, cultural memory, the evolution of ideas, and how information changes as it passes through different mediums and minds.

5. **Technical Archaeology**: Ask the LLM about obscure technical knowledge, lost practices, or forgotten methodologies in your field. Where does it successfully resurrect this knowledge, and where does it falter?

6. **Historical Empathy**: Explore whether and how the LLM can represent the emotional and experiential dimensions of historical contexts. Can it simulate not just what people knew but how they felt?

7. **Metaconversation About Archives**: Talk with the LLM about the nature of archives themselves—how knowledge is preserved, transformed, lost, and rediscovered. Discuss the Internet Archive specifically as a repository of human thought.

8. **Transmission Errors**: Identify places where the LLM misrepresents historical information, confabulates details, or blends anachronistic elements. What patterns do you see in these failures?

9. **Invented Mythologies**: Collaborate with the LLM to construct entirely new myths—stories that draw on the structure of ancient epics, religious texts, or folk tales, but address contemporary anxieties, technologies, or global crises. What cultural codes are carried forward? What new symbols emerge?

10. **Temporal Hybridity**: Ask the LLM to fuse timelines—e.g., to imagine a Renaissance polymath reflecting on quantum mechanics, or a medieval monk encountering a neural net. What frictions or revelations arise when radically different epistemologies are layered in speculative dialogue?


## Prompting Strategies

As you converse with this living archive, experiment with different approaches:

- **Temporal questioning**: Ask the LLM to respond from different historical perspectives or time periods
- **Source citation requests**: Ask the LLM to identify where specific information might be coming from
- **Comparative historical analysis**: Request the LLM to compare how different eras would approach the same problem
- **Counterfactual explorations**: Discuss how knowledge might have developed differently given alternative historical events
- **Resurrection of lost knowledge**: Attempt to recover obscure, forgotten, or marginalized perspectives
- **Socratic dialogue across time**: Use historical questioning methods to examine contemporary issues
- **Archival gaps identification**: Explore what knowledge seems absent or distorted in the LLM's responses
- **Evolutionary traces**: Examine how ideas, concepts, or technical approaches evolved over time

Document which strategies elicited the most interesting, surprising, or revealing responses.

## Suggested Timeline

- **Weeks 1-2**: Initial exploration of the LLM as an archive—test its knowledge of historical perspectives in your field
- **Weeks 3-4**: Deepen the conversation by exploring tensions between historical and contemporary understandings
- **Weeks 5-6**: Philosophical and meta-cognitive reflection on archives, memory, and knowledge transmission
- **Final Week**: Complete analysis and reflection components

   - Your observations about the fidelity and distortions in its historical knowledge
   - Notable patterns in how information seems to be preserved or lost in the LLM's training

## A Note on the Spirit of This Assignment

This assignment is not about "testing" or "tricking" the LLM. Rather, it invites you to engage with it as a kind of living Internet Archive—a reanimation of texts that would otherwise remain static and silent on server farms around the world. As you converse with this reanimation of our collective textual knowledge, consider what it reveals about how we preserve, transmit, and transform human understanding across time.

Remember these words from the essay that inspired this assignment: "What it is like to be us, in our full humanity—this isn't out there in the interwebs. It isn't stored in any archive, and the neural networks cannot be inward with what it feels like to be you, right now, looking at these words, looking away from these words to think about your life and our lives, turning from all this to your day and to what you will do in it, with others or alone. That can only be lived."

Is this true? When we speak with these systems, are we genuinely accessing the preserved thoughts of countless authors across time, or merely interacting with a sophisticated simulation? What aspects of human knowledge survive this transformation from written text to conversational AI, and what is inevitably lost? Your conversation is an opportunity to explore these boundaries between archive and experience, text and understanding, past and present.

## Submission Instructions

Submit all components via the course website on Canvas. The conversation transcript should be provided as a single document (plain text or Markdown). Your analysis and reflection may be submitted in whatever format best serves your multi-modal approach.



Good luck, and may your conversations with our collective dead letters prove illuminating.
