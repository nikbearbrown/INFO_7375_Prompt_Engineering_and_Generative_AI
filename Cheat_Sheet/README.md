  - **Benefits**: 
    - Uses 0.1-1% of full fine-tuning parameters
    - Minimal memory overhead
    - Easy to switch between adaptations
  - **Implementation**:
    ```python
    from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model
    
    lora_config = LoraConfig(
        r=16,  # Rank of update matrices
        lora_alpha=32,  # Scaling factor
        target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"],  # Which layers to adapt
        lora_dropout=0.05,
        bias="none"
    )
    
    peft_model = get_peft_model(base_model, lora_config)
    ```

- **QLoRA (Quantized LoRA)**:
  - **Concept**: Quantize the base model to 4 or 8 bits, then apply LoRA
  - **Benefits**:
    - Even more memory efficient
    - Can fine-tune larger models on consumer hardware
    - Minimal performance loss
  - **Use Cases**:
    - Fine-tuning large models with limited GPU resources

- **Data Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "instruction": "Translate the following text to French",
    "input": "Hello, how are you doing today?",
    "output": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?"
  }
  ```
- **Best Practices**:
  - Include diverse instruction types (explain, summarize, translate, etc.)
  - Vary instruction complexity
  - Include examples with different levels of detail in inputs and outputs
  - Create a balanced dataset across instruction types

### Training Process and Hyperparameters

  - Consider learning rate schedulers (cosine, linear decay)

- **Batch Size**:
  - Larger is generally better for stability
  - Use gradient accumulation for effective larger batches
  - Typical values: 4-64 depending on model size and hardware

- **Training Steps/Epochs**:
  - Monitor validation loss to prevent overfitting
  - Typically 1-3 epochs for large datasets
  - More epochs (5-10) for smaller datasets

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Perplexity: How well the model predicts the text
  - Task-specific metrics: ROUGE for summarization, BLEU for translation
  - Human evaluation: Essential for subjective quality assessment
