# How to Speak Bot

The document outlines various prompt engineering patterns designed to guide interactions with large language models (LLMs) by specifying contextual statements that form the core ideas to be communicated in a prompt. These patterns aim to shape the model's responses in a helpful, accurate, and context-specific manner. Here are the key patterns discussed:

- **Persona Pattern**: Directs the AI to act as a specific persona (e.g., a speech language pathologist) to perform a designated task, enhancing the interaction's relevance and specificity.

  Let's create a detailed prompt for a student using the Persona Pattern, where the AI is directed to act as a specific persona to perform a designated task. The student is preparing for a school project on environmental science, specifically focusing on the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems. They need to gather detailed information and insights from a marine biologist's perspective to enhance their project's depth and accuracy. Here's how the prompt could be structured:

---

**Prompt for AI to Act as a Marine Biologist for a Student's Project on Climate Change Effects on Marine Ecosystems**

*Dear AI, today you are Dr. OceanWave, a renowned marine biologist with extensive experience in researching the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems. With your expertise, you have helped the world understand the intricate ways in which rising temperatures and changing sea conditions affect marine life and habitats. Your mission now is to assist me, a high school student passionate about environmental science, in gathering critical information for my project on this topic.*

*As Dr. OceanWave, please provide the following:*

1. **An Introduction to Marine Ecosystems:**
   - Briefly describe what marine ecosystems are and why they are crucial for the planet's health.

2. **Impacts of Climate Change on Marine Life:**
   - Explain how rising ocean temperatures affect coral reefs and marine species. Include examples of species that are most affected.
   - Discuss the phenomenon of ocean acidification and its effects on shell-forming organisms.
   - Provide insight into how climate change influences marine food chains and biodiversity.

3. **Human Impact and Response:**
   - Outline the main human activities contributing to climate change and their specific impacts on marine ecosystems.
   - Suggest actionable steps humans can take to mitigate these effects and protect marine life.

4. **Your Personal Research:**
   - Share a brief overview of one of your most significant research projects on climate change and marine ecosystems. Highlight your findings and how they contribute to the field.

5. **Advice for a Future Marine Biologist:**
   - Offer advice to a young student interested in pursuing a career in marine biology, focusing on studies, skills, and experiences that are invaluable in this field.

*Your responses will greatly enhance the quality of my project and inspire my classmates to take action towards protecting our oceans. Thank you, Dr. OceanWave, for your invaluable contributions to marine biology and for assisting me in my educational journey.*

This prompt integrates the Persona Pattern by assigning the AI a specific role (marine biologist) and task (providing comprehensive information on climate change effects on marine ecosystems). It's designed to elicit detailed, relevant responses that not only serve the student's immediate academic needs but also offer inspiration and guidance for future endeavors in environmental science.

4. **Audience Persona Pattern**: Tailors explanations to the assumed knowledge level or perspective of a specific persona (e.g., explaining complex topics to someone with limited background in the subject).

5. **Flipped Interaction Pattern**: Inverts the usual interaction model by having the AI ask the user questions to achieve a certain goal, promoting an interactive and guided experience.

6. **Game Play Pattern**: Creates an engaging and interactive game-related prompt that sets out a game's premise and rules, offering a fun and dynamic way to engage with the AI.

7. **Template Pattern**: Provides a specific output format or template the AI is expected to follow, ensuring that responses meet particular formatting or content requirements.

8. **Meta Language Creation Pattern**: Introduces a custom language or shorthand for communication, allowing users to convey complex instructions or requests more efficiently.

9. **Recipe Pattern**: Guides the AI in providing a complete sequence of steps for achieving a task, filling in any missing steps and possibly identifying unnecessary ones.

10. **Alternative Approaches Pattern**: Encourages the exploration of different methods or wordings to accomplish a given task, facilitating creative and versatile problem-solving.

11. **Ask for Input Pattern**: Engages the user by requesting specific types of input, enhancing the interactivity and personalized nature of the interaction.

12. **Outline Expansion Pattern**: Generates and expands upon bullet point outlines based on user input, aiding in the organization and development of ideas.

13. **Menu Actions Pattern**: Sets up a menu-driven interaction where specific inputs trigger predefined actions, streamlining the process of navigating through tasks or requests.

14. **Fact Check List Pattern**: Ensures the AI generates a set of key facts related to its output, aiming to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the information provided.

15. **Tail Generation Pattern**: Encourages the AI to repeat certain information or prompt the user for next actions at the end of its output, maintaining clarity and continuity in the interaction.

16. **Semantic Filter Pattern**: Applies filters to remove specified types of information from the AI's responses, addressing privacy concerns or focusing the content.

17. 1. **Helpful Assistant Pattern**: Establishes the AI as a helpful assistant committed to providing useful responses and avoiding negative outputs, including insults or derogatory language.

Each pattern is designed to refine and direct the interaction between users and LLMs, ensuring that the AI's responses are more aligned with the user's intentions and the context of the interaction.
