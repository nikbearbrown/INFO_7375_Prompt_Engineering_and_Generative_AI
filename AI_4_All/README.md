# How to Speak Bot

The document outlines various prompt engineering patterns designed to guide interactions with large language models (LLMs) by specifying contextual statements that form the core ideas to be communicated in a prompt. These patterns aim to shape the model's responses in a helpful, accurate, and context-specific manner. Here are the key patterns discussed:

1. **Helpful Assistant Pattern**: Establishes the AI as a helpful assistant committed to providing useful responses and avoiding negative outputs, including insults or derogatory language.

2. **Persona Pattern**: Directs the AI to act as a specific persona (e.g., a speech language pathologist) to perform a designated task, enhancing the interaction's relevance and specificity.

3. **Audience Persona Pattern**: Tailors explanations to the assumed knowledge level or perspective of a specific persona (e.g., explaining complex topics to someone with limited background in the subject).

4. **Flipped Interaction Pattern**: Inverts the usual interaction model by having the AI ask the user questions to achieve a certain goal, promoting an interactive and guided experience.

5. **Game Play Pattern**: Creates an engaging and interactive game-related prompt that sets out a game's premise and rules, offering a fun and dynamic way to engage with the AI.

6. **Template Pattern**: Provides a specific output format or template the AI is expected to follow, ensuring that responses meet particular formatting or content requirements.

7. **Meta Language Creation Pattern**: Introduces a custom language or shorthand for communication, allowing users to convey complex instructions or requests more efficiently.

8. **Recipe Pattern**: Guides the AI in providing a complete sequence of steps for achieving a task, filling in any missing steps and possibly identifying unnecessary ones.

9. **Alternative Approaches Pattern**: Encourages the exploration of different methods or wordings to accomplish a given task, facilitating creative and versatile problem-solving.

10. **Ask for Input Pattern**: Engages the user by requesting specific types of input, enhancing the interactivity and personalized nature of the interaction.

11. **Outline Expansion Pattern**: Generates and expands upon bullet point outlines based on user input, aiding in the organization and development of ideas.

12. **Menu Actions Pattern**: Sets up a menu-driven interaction where specific inputs trigger predefined actions, streamlining the process of navigating through tasks or requests.

13. **Fact Check List Pattern**: Ensures the AI generates a set of key facts related to its output, aiming to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the information provided.

14. **Tail Generation Pattern**: Encourages the AI to repeat certain information or prompt the user for next actions at the end of its output, maintaining clarity and continuity in the interaction.

15. **Semantic Filter Pattern**: Applies filters to remove specified types of information from the AI's responses, addressing privacy concerns or focusing the content.

Each pattern is designed to refine and direct the interaction between users and LLMs, ensuring that the AI's responses are more aligned with the user's intentions and the context of the interaction.
