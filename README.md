# INFO 7375: Prompt Engineering and Agentic AI

*Unleashing the power of Generative AI through effective prompting and intelligent agents*

## Summer 2025 Schedule

**Schedule:** Tuesday, Thursday  
**Dates:** 05/05/2025 – 08/16/2025  
**Type:** Class  

**Time:** 01:30 PM – 03:10 PM  
**Location:** Online Campus | Virtual Space – Online class | Room: ROOM  


## Course Overview
This comprehensive course explores the art and science of crafting prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) and developing intelligent AI agents. Students will master prompt engineering techniques, integration with vector databases, and the creation of agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory retention, and tool usage. The course balances theoretical foundations with practical applications across various domains.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Craft effective prompts that elicit desired responses from LLMs for various applications
- Implement vector databases and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for enhanced AI capabilities
- Develop AI agents with robust knowledge bases, memory, and reasoning capabilities
- Integrate external tools to enhance agent functionality
- Apply ethical considerations in AI development and deployment

## Required Materials
- **Textbook**: "Prompt Engineering for Generative AI" by Nik Bear Brown
- **Programming**: Python 3.8+
- **Frameworks**: LangChain, LangGraph, FAISS/Pinecone
- **LLM Access**: Access to LLM APIs (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)

## Grading Policy
Due to widespread use of Generative AI, grading is adjusted as follows:
- **Students scoring 80% or higher** will be graded relatively based on class performance:
  - Top 25%: A
  - Next 25%: A-
  - Next 25%: B+
  - Final 25%: B
- **Students scoring below 80%** will receive grades based on the traditional scale (maximum B-)
- Late submissions incur a 10% deduction per day
