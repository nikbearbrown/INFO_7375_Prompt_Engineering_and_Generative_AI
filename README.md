Got it — thanks for the clarification.

You're saying:

- **If a student scores 80% or above**, **the grade is assigned *relatively* (curved)**, *not* by the absolute "94–100 = A" scale.
- **If a student scores below 80%**, **then** the *absolute scale* (94–100 = A, etc.) is used to assign grades — **but they can only get a maximum of B-** if they are under 80%.

Here’s the corrected and cleaner version based on that:

---

# Grading Policies

A **point system** is used for grading. Every assignment, project, and exam you are expected to complete is assigned a point value, ranging from 1 to 1000 points.

- **Late submissions** incur a **10% deduction per day**, rounded up.
- **Exams** cannot be made up unless **prior arrangements** have been made.

## Updated Grading Approach

**Due to the widespread use of Generative AI,** grading is adjusted as follows:

- **Students scoring 80% or higher (absolute scale)** will be graded **relatively** based on class performance:
  - **Top 25%** (rounded to the nearest integer): **A**
  - **Next 25%**: **A-**
  - **Next 25%**: **B+**
  - **Final 25%**: **B**

- **Students scoring below 80% (absolute scale)** will be graded based on the **traditional absolute grading scale** below:

| Score | Grade |
|:-----:|:-----:|
| 78–79 | C+ |
| 73–77 | C |
| 70–72 | C- |
| 60–69 | D |
| Below 60 | F |

- **Important**: Students below 80% cannot earn a grade higher than B-, even if the relative curve would otherwise place them higher.

## Notes
- The instructor **reserves the right** to make minor adjustments for fairness.
- Students are encouraged to complete all work independently and ethically, especially in light of Generative AI use.

### Quick Summary
| Situation | Grading Method |
|:---------:|:--------------:|
| 80% and above | Curved: Top 25% get A, next 25% A-, etc. |
| Below 80% | Fixed absolute scale (max B- or lower) |

Would you also like a super-brief one-paragraph version for the syllabus too, just in case?  
It would be easy for students to read at a glance.
