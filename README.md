## nikbearbrown YouTube channel

Over the course of the semester I'll be making and posting additional data science and machine learning related videos on my YouTube channel.

https://www.youtube.com/user/nikbearbrown

The purpose of these videos is to provide additional advanced content as well as supplemental material to enhance coverage of the course topics. Suggestions for additional video topics are always welcome.

## Teaching assistants

The Teaching assistants are:

TBA

Programming questions should first go to the TAs. If they can't answer them, the TAs will forward the questions to the Professor.

## Learning Assessment

Achievement of learning outcomes will be assessed and graded through:

- Quizzes
- Exams
- Completion of assignments 
- Completion of term projects
- Participation (Counts as a 100 point assignment) - TAs will track meaningful contributions to the class and assign a score between 0-100 at the end of finals.
- ATTENDANCE (Counts as a 100 point assignment) - TAs will track whether you are in class. Zoom attendance does not count as attendance.

## Reaching out for help

Students can always reach out for help to the Professor, Nik Bear Brown (ni.brown@neu.edu). In an online course, it's important that students reach out early if they encounter any issues.

## Grading Policies 

A point system is used. Everything you are expected to turn in has points. Points can range from 1 point to 1000 points. Assignments receive a 10% deduction for each day they are late, rounded up. Exams cannot be made up unless arrangements are made before the exam.

I expect to use the following as a rough grading scale at the end of the semester. You should not expect a curve to be applied; but I reserve the right to use one. The curve may go up or down. For example, it is possible for a 95 to be an A-.

| Score | Grade |
|-------|-------|
| 93 – 100 | A |
| 90 – 92 | A- |
| 88 – 89 | B+ |
| 83 – 87 | B |
| 80 – 82 | B- |
| 78 – 79 | C+ |
| 73 – 77 | C |
| 70 – 72 | C- |
| 60 – 69 | D |
| <60 | F |

Scores in-between grades (for example, 82.5 or 92.3) will be decided based on the exams.  

*Note: The score is calculated using the grading rubric and IS NOT the average of the assignments displayed by Canvas.*

There will be two major projects due near the end of the semester worth approximately 50% of the total grade. A VFX assignment in Houdini and a game/real-time 3D assignment in either Unreal Engine or Unity 3D.

## Canvas

You will submit your assignments via Canvas and GitHub. Click the title of assignment (Canvas -> assignment -> <Title of Assignment>), to go to the submission page. You will know your score on an assignment, project, or test via Canvas. Canvas displays only the raw scores, not normalized or curved grades. A Jupyter notebook file ALONG with either a .DOC or .PDF rendering of that Jupyter notebook file must be submitted with each assignment.

Your name MUST be part of your submission, for example Sanchez_Rick_Assignment_1.zip

Multiple files must be zipped. No .RAR, .bz, .7z or other extensions.

Assignment file names MUST start with student's last name then first name OR the group's name and include the class number and assignment number. 

Assignments MUST estimate the percentage of code written by the student and that which came from external sources. 

Assignments MUST specify a license at the bottom of each notebook turned in.

All code must adhere to a style guide and state which guide was used.

## Due dates

Due dates for assignments are midnight on the due date of the assignment.

Five percent (i.e., 5%) is deducted for each day an assignment is late. Solutions will be posted the following Monday. Assignments will receive NO CREDIT if submitted after the solutions are posted. Any extensions MUST be granted via email and with a specific new due date.

Only ONE extension will be granted per semester.

- Note any modifications you made to AI-generated content
- Be prepared to discuss your collaboration with AI during evaluation

By following this policy, you can ethically leverage AI tools while ensuring they enhance rather than replace your learning experience in this course.

## Participation Policy 

Participation in discussions is an important aspect of the class. It is important that both students and instructional staff help foster an environment in which students feel safe asking questions, posing their opinions, and sharing their work for critique. If at any time you feel this environment is being threatened—by other students, the TA, or the professor—speak up and make your concerns heard. If you feel uncomfortable broaching this topic with the professor, you should feel free to voice your concerns to the Dean's office.

## Collaboration Policies 

Students are strongly encouraged to collaborate through discussing strategies for completing assignments, talking about the readings before class, and studying for the exams. However, all work that you turn in with your name on it must be in your own words or coded in your own style. Directly copied code or text from any other source MUST be cited. In any case, you must write up your solutions in your own words. Furthermore, if you did collaborate on any problem, you must clearly list all of the collaborators in your submission. Handing in the same work for more than one course without explicit permission is forbidden.
 
Feel free to discuss general strategies, but any written work or code should be your own, in your own words/style. If you have collaborated on ideas leading up to the final solution, give each other credit on what you turn in, clearly labeling who contributed what ideas. Individuals should be able to explain the function of every aspect of group-produced work. Not understanding what plagiarism is does not constitute an excuse for committing it. You should familiarize yourself with the University's policies on academic dishonesty at the beginning of the semester. If you have any doubts whatsoever about whether you are breaking the rules – ask! 

Any submitted work violating the collaboration policies WILL BE GIVEN A ZERO even if "by mistake." Multiple violations will be sent to OSCCR for disciplinary review.

To reiterate: plagiarism and cheating are strictly forbidden. No excuses, no exceptions. All incidents of plagiarism and cheating will be sent to OSCCR for disciplinary review.

## Assignment Late Policy 

Assignments are due by 11:59pm on the due date marked on the schedule. It is your responsibility to determine whether or not it is worth spending the extra time on an assignment vs. turning in incomplete work for partial credit without penalty. Any exceptions to this policy (e.g., long-term illness or family emergencies) must be approved by the professor.

Assignments will receive NO CREDIT if submitted after the solutions are posted. Any extensions MUST be granted via email and with a specific new due date.

Only ONE extension will be granted per semester.

## Student Resources

### Special Accommodations/ADA
In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA 1990), Northeastern University seeks to provide equal access to its programs, services, and activities. If you will need accommodations in this class, please contact the Disability Resource Center (www.northeastern.edu/drc/) as soon as possible to make appropriate arrangements, and please provide the course instructors with any necessary documentation. The University requires that you provide documentation of your disabilities to the DRC so that they may identify what accommodations are required, and arrange with the instructor to provide those on your behalf, as needed.

### Academic Integrity
All students must adhere to the university's Academic Integrity Policy, which can be found on the website of the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution (OSCCR), at http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academicintegrity/index.html. Please be particularly aware of the policy regarding plagiarism. As you probably know, plagiarism involves representing anyone else's words or ideas as your own. It doesn't matter where you got these ideas—from a book, on the web, from a fellow student, from your mother. It doesn't matter whether you quote the source directly or paraphrase it; if you are not the originator of the words or ideas, you must state clearly and specifically where they came from. Please consult an instructor if you have any confusion or concerns when preparing any of the assignments. You can also consult the guide "Avoiding Plagiarism" on the NU Library Website at http://www.lib.neu.edu/online_research/help/avoiding_plagiarism/. If an academic integrity concern arises, one of the instructors will speak with you about it; if the discussion does not resolve the concern, we will refer the matter to OSCCR.

### Writing Center
The Northeastern University Writing Center, housed in the Department of English within the College of Social Sciences and Humanities, is open to any member of the Northeastern community and exists to help any level writer, from any academic discipline, become a better writer. You can book face-to-face, online, or same day appointments in two locations: 412 Holmes Hall and 136 Snell Library (behind Argo Tea).
