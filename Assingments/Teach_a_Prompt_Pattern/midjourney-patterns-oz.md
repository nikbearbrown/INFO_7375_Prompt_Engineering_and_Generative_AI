# Midjourney Patterns: The Wizard of Oz Character Guide

## Introduction

This tutorial explores two powerful prompt patterns for Midjourney using characters from The Wizard of Oz as our creative foundation. We'll examine both the Parameter Pattern and Template Pattern approaches, with practical examples for photography and illustration styles.

## Part 1: The Parameter Pattern

The Parameter Pattern focuses on using specific modifiers and technical parameters to control how Midjourney generates images. This approach emphasizes **what specific elements** to include to achieve desired visual effects.

### Core Components

1. **Descriptive Modifiers**: Words and phrases that influence visual attributes
2. **Technical Parameters**: Command-line style instructions that control generation settings

### Wizard of Oz Character Examples Using Parameter Pattern

Let's explore how to use the Parameter Pattern with Wizard of Oz characters:

#### Dorothy

**Photography Style with Parameters:**
```
Young farm girl Dorothy Gale in blue gingham dress with ruby slippers, standing on yellow brick road, realistic photography, natural lighting, Kodak Portra 400 film, 85mm lens, shallow depth of field --ar 4:5 --stylize 100 --chaos 0 --v 5.2
```

This prompt uses photography-specific parameters to create a realistic portrait with controlled stylization and aspect ratio.

**Illustration Style with Parameters:**
```
Dorothy Gale in blue gingham dress holding Toto, whimsical children's book illustration, colorful watercolor style, soft pastel colors, storybook quality --ar 1:1 --stylize 400 --chaos 20 --v 5
```

This uses illustration-specific parameters with increased stylization and some chaos for a more artistic interpretation.

#### Scarecrow

**Photography Style with Parameters:**
```
Scarecrow character with straw hat and patched clothes, standing in Kansas wheat field, golden hour photography, documentary style, textural detail, Sony A7R IV, 35mm lens --ar 3:2 --stylize 50 --chaos 15 --v 5.2
```

The low stylization and specific camera reference create a more photorealistic documentary feel.

**Illustration Style with Parameters:**
```
Whimsical scarecrow character with straw hair, illustrated character design, pen and watercolor, vibrant autumn colors, children's book style --ar 2:3 --stylize 750 --chaos 30 --v 5
```

Higher stylization and chaos values create a more interpretive, artistic illustration.

#### Tin Man

**Photography Style with Parameters:**
```
Silver metallic Tin Man character, art deco style, studio photography, polished chrome surface, dramatic studio lighting, high contrast black background, detailed texture --ar 4:5 --stylize 200 --chaos 0 --v 5.2
```

The specific lighting and texture details with moderate stylization create a dramatic photographic portrait.

**Illustration Style with Parameters:**
```
Heartless Tin Man character, retro comic book illustration, silver metallic body, blue line art, flat colors, vintage comic style --ar 2:3 --stylize 850 --chaos 25 --v 5
```

High stylization paired with specific art style references creates a distinct illustration style.

## Part 2: The Template Pattern

The Template Pattern focuses on creating a consistent **structural framework** for your prompts. It provides a reusable format with placeholders that can be filled with different content while maintaining the same overall organization.

### Core Template Structure

Let's establish a template for character portraits:

```
[Character] from [Source], [Medium], [Art Style], [Lighting Effect], [Color Scheme], [Costume Detail], [Pose], [Emotional Expression]
```

### Wizard of Oz Examples Using Template Pattern

Let's apply this template to various Wizard of Oz characters:

#### Cowardly Lion

**Template:**
```
[Character] from [Source], [Medium], [Art Style], [Lighting Effect], [Color Scheme], [Costume Detail], [Pose], [Emotional Expression]
```

**Photography Example:**
```
Cowardly Lion from Wizard of Oz, realistic photography, wildlife portrait style, dappled forest lighting, golden amber color scheme, ornate medallion of courage, cowering defensive pose, fearful expression
```

This creates a photorealistic portrait of the Cowardly Lion with specific mood and lighting elements that maintain a photographic quality.

**Illustration Example:**
```
Cowardly Lion from Wizard of Oz, digital illustration, Disney animation style, warm backlighting, vibrant yellow and brown color scheme, regal mane and tail, proud standing pose, newfound confident expression
```

This creates a more stylized, animated interpretation of the character showing his transformation after receiving courage.

#### Wicked Witch of the West

**Template:**
```
[Character] from [Source], [Medium], [Art Style], [Lighting Effect], [Color Scheme], [Costume Detail], [Pose], [Emotional Expression]
```

**Photography Example:**
```
Wicked Witch of the West from Wizard of Oz, cinematic photography, gothic portrait style, eerie green lighting, dark emerald and black color scheme, pointed black hat and flowing robes, casting spell pose, menacing expression
```

This creates a dramatic, photorealistic portrait with cinematic quality focusing on the witch's threatening nature.

**Illustration Example:**
```
Wicked Witch of the West from Wizard of Oz, vector illustration, modern minimalist style, dramatic shadows, limited green and purple color palette, geometric hat silhouette, flying on broomstick pose, wicked smile expression
```

This creates a contemporary, stylized illustration with graphic design elements and a more abstracted approach.

#### Glinda the Good Witch

**Template:**
```
[Character] from [Source], [Medium], [Art Style], [Lighting Effect], [Color Scheme], [Costume Detail], [Pose], [Emotional Expression]
```

**Photography Example:**
```
Glinda the Good Witch from Wizard of Oz, fantasy portrait photography, ethereal fairy tale style, soft diffused lighting, pastel pink and pearl color scheme, crystal crown and flowing gown, floating gracefully pose, serene benevolent expression
```

This creates a dreamy, photorealistic portrait with specific lighting and textural details maintaining photographic quality.

**Illustration Example:**
```
Glinda the Good Witch from Wizard of Oz, children's book illustration, whimsical storybook style, magical sparkling lighting, cotton candy pink and gold color scheme, star-tipped wand and bubble details, arms outstretched pose, kind motherly expression
```

This creates a more stylized, illustrated interpretation focusing on the character's magical and nurturing qualities.

#### The Great Oz

**Template:**
```
[Character] from [Source], [Medium], [Art Style], [Lighting Effect], [Color Scheme], [Costume Detail], [Pose], [Emotional Expression]
```

**Photography Example:**
```
The Great Oz from Wizard of Oz, theatrical photography, dramatic stage portrait style, smoke and projection lighting, emerald green and gold color scheme, ornate wizard robes and medallion, imposing stance pose, mysterious authoritative expression
```

This creates a staged, dramatic photographic portrait focusing on the illusory nature of the character.

**Illustration Example:**
```
The Great Oz from Wizard of Oz, retro poster illustration, 1930s Art Deco style, dramatic spotlighting, bold green and red color scheme, floating wizard head with mechanical controls, behind the curtain pose, fraudulent panicked expression
```

This creates a period-appropriate illustration style revealing the man behind the curtain.

## Part 3: Advanced Combined Templates with Parameters

For even more control, we can combine both patterns into a comprehensive approach:

### Combined Template with Parameters

```
[Character] from [Source], [Medium], [Art Style], [Lighting Effect], [Color Scheme], [Costume Detail], [Pose], [Emotional Expression] --ar [Aspect Ratio] --stylize [Value] --chaos [Value] --v [Version]
```

### Example with Multiple Oz Characters

**Combined Approach:**
```
Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion from Wizard of Oz, detailed digital painting, fantasy adventure style, golden yellow lighting, vibrant rainbow color scheme, iconic character costumes, walking arm-in-arm pose, joyful hopeful expressions --ar 16:9 --stylize 500 --chaos 25 --v 5.2
```

This combined approach gives you both the structural consistency of a template and the technical control of specific parameters.

## Part 4: Advanced Character-Specific Templates

You can also create specialized templates for different character types:

### Protagonist Template

```

```

## Conclusion

Both the Parameter Pattern and Template Pattern offer powerful approaches to controlling Midjourney outputs. The Parameter Pattern gives you precise technical control, while the Template Pattern provides consistent structural organization.

For Wizard of Oz characters specifically:
- Use Parameter Pattern when focusing on technical aspects like aspect ratio and stylization level
- Use Template Pattern when you want consistent character portraits across multiple characters
- Combine both for maximum control and consistency

By using these characters as examples, you can see how different prompt patterns significantly impact the style, mood, and presentation of your generated images.
