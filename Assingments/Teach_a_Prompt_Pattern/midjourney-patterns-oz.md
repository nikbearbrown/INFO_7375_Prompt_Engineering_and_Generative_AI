# Template Pattern Tutorial: Using Wizard of Oz Characters in Midjourney

## Understanding the Template Pattern

The Template Pattern is a powerful approach for creating consistent, structured prompts for AI image generation. At its core, this pattern establishes a reusable framework with clearly defined placeholder elements that you can fill with different content while maintaining the same organizational structure.

Think of it like a fill-in-the-blank form where the blank spaces represent specific aspects of what you want to generate. By using this consistent structure, you can:
- Create a series of related images with consistent formatting
- Easily modify individual elements without rewriting entire prompts
- Ensure you don't forget important components in complex prompts
- Quickly experiment with different creative directions

Now let's explore this pattern using Wizard of Oz characters as our creative foundation!

# Midjourney Patterns: The Wizard of Oz Character Guide
by Nik Bear Brown


## Introduction

This tutorial explores two powerful prompt patterns for Midjourney using characters from The Wizard of Oz as our creative foundation. We'll examine both the Parameter Pattern and Template Pattern approaches, with practical examples for photography and illustration styles.

## Part 1: The Parameter Pattern

The Parameter Pattern focuses on using specific modifiers and technical parameters to control how Midjourney generates images. This approach emphasizes **what specific elements** to include to achieve desired visual effects.

### Core Components

1. **Descriptive Modifiers**: Words and phrases that influence visual attributes
2. **Technical Parameters**: Command-line style instructions that control generation settings

### Wizard of Oz Character Examples Using Parameter Pattern

Let's explore how to use the Parameter Pattern with Wizard of Oz characters:

#### Dorothy

**Photography Style with Parameters:**
```
Young farm girl Dorothy Gale in blue gingham dress with ruby slippers, standing on yellow brick road, realistic photography, natural lighting, Kodak Portra 400 film, 85mm lens, shallow depth of field --ar 4:5 --stylize 100 --chaos 0 --v 7
```

This prompt uses photography-specific parameters to create a realistic portrait with controlled stylization and aspect ratio.

**Illustration Style with Parameters:**
```
Dorothy Gale in blue gingham dress holding Toto, whimsical children's book illustration, colorful watercolor style, soft pastel colors, storybook quality --ar 1:1 --stylize 400 --chaos 20 --v 7
```

This uses illustration-specific parameters with increased stylization and some chaos for a more artistic interpretation.

#### Scarecrow

**Photography Style with Parameters:**
```
Scarecrow character with straw hat and patched clothes, standing in Kansas wheat field, golden hour photography, documentary style, textural detail, Sony A7R IV, 35mm lens --ar 3:2 --stylize 50 --chaos 15 --v 7
```

The low stylization and specific camera reference create a more photorealistic documentary feel.

**Illustration Style with Parameters:**
```
Whimsical scarecrow character with straw hair, illustrated character design, pen and watercolor, vibrant autumn colors, children's book style --ar 2:3 --stylize 750 --chaos 30 --v 7
```

Higher stylization and chaos values create a more interpretive, artistic illustration.

#### Tin Man

**Photography Style with Parameters:**
```
Silver metallic Tin Man character, art deco style, studio photography, polished chrome surface, dramatic studio lighting, high contrast black background, detailed texture --ar 4:5 --stylize 200 --chaos 0 --v 7
```

The specific lighting and texture details with moderate stylization create a dramatic photographic portrait.

**Illustration Style with Parameters:**
```
Heartless Tin Man character, retro comic book illustration, silver metallic body, blue line art, flat colors, vintage comic style --ar 2:3 --stylize 850 --chaos 25 --v 7
```

High stylization paired with specific art style references creates a distinct illustration style.

## Part 2: The Template Pattern

The Template Pattern focuses on creating a consistent **structural framework** for your prompts. It provides a reusable format with placeholders that can be filled with different content while maintaining the same overall organization.

### Core Template Structure

Let's establish a template for character portraits:

```
[Character] from [Source], [Medium], [Art Style], [Lighting Effect], [Color Scheme], [Costume Detail], [Pose], [Emotional Expression]
```

### Wizard of Oz Examples Using Template Pattern

Let's apply this template to various Wizard of Oz characters:

#### Cowardly Lion

**Template:**
```
[Character] from [Source], [Medium], [Art Style], [Lighting Effect], [Color Scheme], [Costume Detail], [Pose], [Emotional Expression]
```

**Photography Example:**
```
Cowardly Lion from Wizard of Oz, realistic photography, wildlife portrait style, dappled forest lighting, golden amber color scheme, ornate medallion of courage, cowering defensive pose, fearful expression
```

This creates a photorealistic portrait of the Cowardly Lion with specific mood and lighting elements that maintain a photographic quality.

**Illustration Example:**
```
Cowardly Lion from Wizard of Oz, digital illustration, Disney animation style, warm backlighting, vibrant yellow and brown color scheme, regal mane and tail, proud standing pose, newfound confident expression
```

This creates a more stylized, animated interpretation of the character showing his transformation after receiving courage.

#### Wicked Witch of the West

**Template:**
```
[Character] from [Source], [Medium], [Art Style], [Lighting Effect], [Color Scheme], [Costume Detail], [Pose], [Emotional Expression]
```

**Photography Example:**
```
Wicked Witch of the West from Wizard of Oz, cinematic photography, gothic portrait style, eerie green lighting, dark emerald and black color scheme, pointed black hat and flowing robes, casting spell pose, menacing expression
```

This creates a dramatic, photorealistic portrait with cinematic quality focusing on the witch's threatening nature.

**Illustration Example:**
```
Wicked Witch of the West from Wizard of Oz, vector illustration, modern minimalist style, dramatic shadows, limited green and purple color palette, geometric hat silhouette, flying on broomstick pose, wicked smile expression
```

This creates a contemporary, stylized illustration with graphic design elements and a more abstracted approach.

#### Glinda the Good Witch

**Template:**
```
[Character] from [Source], [Medium], [Art Style], [Lighting Effect], [Color Scheme], [Costume Detail], [Pose], [Emotional Expression]
```

**Photography Example:**
```
Glinda the Good Witch from Wizard of Oz, fantasy portrait photography, ethereal fairy tale style, soft diffused lighting, pastel pink and pearl color scheme, crystal crown and flowing gown, floating gracefully pose, serene benevolent expression
```

This creates a dreamy, photorealistic portrait with specific lighting and textural details maintaining photographic quality.

**Illustration Example:**
```
Glinda the Good Witch from Wizard of Oz, children's book illustration, whimsical storybook style, magical sparkling lighting, cotton candy pink and gold color scheme, star-tipped wand and bubble details, arms outstretched pose, kind motherly expression
```

This creates a more stylized, illustrated interpretation focusing on the character's magical and nurturing qualities.

#### The Great Oz

**Template:**
```
[Character] from [Source], [Medium], [Art Style], [Lighting Effect], [Color Scheme], [Costume Detail], [Pose], [Emotional Expression]
```

**Photography Example:**
```
The Great Oz from Wizard of Oz, theatrical photography, dramatic stage portrait style, smoke and projection lighting, emerald green and gold color scheme, ornate wizard robes and medallion, imposing stance pose, mysterious authoritative expression
```

This creates a staged, dramatic photographic portrait focusing on the illusory nature of the character.

**Illustration Example:**
```
The Great Oz from Wizard of Oz, retro poster illustration, 1930s Art Deco style, dramatic spotlighting, bold green and red color scheme, floating wizard head with mechanical controls, behind the curtain pose, fraudulent panicked expression
```

This creates a period-appropriate illustration style revealing the man behind the curtain.

## Part 3: Advanced Combined Templates with Parameters

For even more control, we can combine both patterns into a comprehensive approach:

### Combined Template with Parameters

```
[Character] from [Source], [Medium], [Art Style], [Lighting Effect], [Color Scheme], [Costume Detail], [Pose], [Emotional Expression] --ar [Aspect Ratio] --stylize [Value] --chaos [Value] --v [Version]
```

### Example with Multiple Oz Characters

**Combined Approach:**
```
Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion from Wizard of Oz, detailed digital painting, fantasy adventure style, golden yellow lighting, vibrant rainbow color scheme, iconic character costumes, walking arm-in-arm pose, joyful hopeful expressions --ar 16:9 --stylize 500 --chaos 25 --v 7
```

This combined approach gives you both the structural consistency of a template and the technical control of specific parameters.

## Part 4: Advanced Character-Specific Templates

You can also create specialized templates for different character types:

### Protagonist Template

```
[Hero Character] from [Source], [Medium], [Heroic Art Style], [Dramatic Lighting], [Symbolic Color Scheme], [Iconic Costume Elements], [Power Pose], [Determined Expression]
```

**Dorothy Example - Photography:**
```
Dorothy Gale from Wizard of Oz, editorial photography, coming-of-age portrait style, journey-weathered lighting, Kansas sepia to Oz technicolor scheme, torn blue dress and polished ruby slippers, standing tall pose, determined homebound expression
```

**Dorothy Example - Illustration:**
```

```

### Villain Template

```
[Villain Character] from [Source], [Medium], [Sinister Art Style], [Ominous Lighting], [Dark Color Scheme], [Menacing Costume Elements], [Threatening Pose], [Evil Expression]
```

**Wicked Witch Example - Photography:**
```
Wicked Witch of the West from Wizard of Oz, character portrait photography, gothic horror style, lightning flash lighting, acidic green and raven black scheme, tattered cape and hooked fingers, casting curse pose, vengeful hateful expression
```

**Wicked Witch Example - Illustration:**
```
Wicked Witch of the West from Wizard of Oz, graphic novel illustration, dark fantasy style, green fire lighting, emerald and obsidian color scheme, spike-shouldered robes and gnarled staff, hunched over crystal ball pose, scheming malevolent expression
```

## Part 5: Location-Based Templates

You can also create templates focused on iconic locations from Oz:

### Location Template

```
[Location] from [Source], [Medium], [Environmental Art Style], [Time of Day Lighting], [Atmospheric Color Scheme], [Key Environmental Features], [Weather Condition], [Mood]
```

**Emerald City - Photography:**
```
Emerald City from Wizard of Oz, architectural photography, Art Deco cityscape style, late afternoon lighting, jade and gold color scheme, towering crystal spires and yellow brick road entrance, magical glowing atmosphere, awe-inspiring majestic mood
```

**Emerald City - Illustration:**
```
Emerald City from Wizard of Oz, animation background art, 1930s fantasy style, sunrise lighting, emerald and ruby color scheme, whimsical curved towers and poppy field foreground, sparkling magical atmosphere, wonder-filled enchanting mood
```

## Conclusion

Both the Parameter Pattern and Template Pattern offer powerful approaches to controlling Midjourney outputs. The Parameter Pattern gives you precise technical control, while the Template Pattern provides consistent structural organization.

For Wizard of Oz characters specifically:
- Use Parameter Pattern when focusing on technical aspects like aspect ratio and stylization level
- Use Template Pattern when you want consistent character portraits across multiple characters
- Combine both for maximum control and consistency

By using these characters as examples, you can see how different prompt patterns significantly impact the style, mood, and presentation of your generated images.



#### Essential Midjourney Parameters: Your Ruby Slippers

##### 1. Aspect Ratio (`--ar`) - The Windows to Oz
Just as different windows in the Wizard's palace showed different views of Oz, the aspect ratio parameter sets the proportions of your image window.

**Usage:**
```
The Yellow Brick Road winding through Munchkinland --ar 16:9
```

**Popular Ratios in Oz:**
* `1:1` (Square) - Perfect for portraits of Oz citizens
* `3:2` (Standard) - Classic views of the Emerald City
* `4:5` (Portrait) - Ideal for character portraits like the Wicked Witch
* `16:9` (Widescreen) - Panoramic views of the Yellow Brick Road
* `9:16` (Vertical) - Tall views of the Wizard's throne room
* `21:9` (Ultrawide) - Cinematic views of the entire Land of Oz

##### 2. Stylize (`--stylize` or `--s`) - The Magic of the Ruby Slippers
Like the varying powers of the Ruby Slippers, this parameter controls how much magical style Midjourney applies. Higher values are like clicking the heels three times—they produce more magical interpretations.

**Usage:**
```
Glinda the Good Witch arriving in her bubble --stylize 750
```

**Magic Levels:**
* `0-100`: Munchkinland-simple with minimal enchantment
* `100-500`: Balanced like the Tin Man's heart
* `500-1000`: Magical as the Emerald City itself

##### 3. Version (`--v`) - Different Lands of Oz
Just as the Land of Oz contains many realms (Munchkinland, Winkie Country, etc.), Midjourney has multiple versions, each with different magical properties.

**Usage:**
```
The Wicked Witch's castle in the Winkie Country --v 7
```

**Realms of Oz:**
* `--v 7`: The latest enchanted realm (released April 2025) 
* `--v 6.1`: The previous magical territory (default model since July 2024)
* `--v 6`: An earlier Land of Oz 
* `--niji 6`: The animated, storybook version of Oz

##### 4. Chaos (`--chaos` or `--c`) - The Whirlwind that Carried Dorothy
Like the unpredictable tornado that brought Dorothy to Oz, the chaos parameter introduces variability into your image. Higher chaos is like a stronger whirlwind, creating more unexpected results.

**Usage:**
```
The tornado carrying Dorothy's house to Oz --chaos 50
```

**Tornado Strengths:**
* `0`: Calm Kansas weather, predictable results
* `25`: Light breeze, mild variation
* `50`: Strong wind, moderate unpredictability
* `75`: Storm brewing, high variation
* `100`: Full tornado, maximum unpredictability

#### Advanced Parameters: The Great and Powerful Tools

##### 5. Quality (`--quality` or `--q`) - The Wizard's Attention
Just as the Wizard could be more or less attentive to visitors, this parameter adjusts how much time and detail goes into your image.

**Usage:**
```
The Wizard of Oz behind his curtain --quality 2
```

**Wizard's Attention Levels:**
* `0.25`: Quick glance (faster)
* `0.5`: Brief audience
* `1`: (Default) Full attention
* `2`: Great and Powerful focus (slower but more detailed)

##### 6. Seed (`--seed`) - Oz Memory Potion
Like a magic potion that helps remember a dream, using a seed ensures consistent results when you use the same prompt again.

**Usage:**
```
Poppies in the field before the Emerald City --seed 12345
```

**Potion Strength:**
* Any whole number between 0 and 4294967295

##### 7. Style Reference (`--sref`) - The Wizard's Crystal Ball
This parameter is like looking into the Wizard's crystal ball to reference a specific vision or style.

**Usage:**
```
Portrait of the Scarecrow thinking --sref 456781234
```

##### 8. No Parameter (`--no`) - Avoiding the Wicked Witch
Just as Dorothy's friends avoided certain dangers in Oz, this parameter excludes specific elements from your image.

**Usage:**
```
The Emerald City celebration --no wicked witch, flying monkeys, poppies
```

##### 9. Tile (`--tile`) - The Yellow Brick Road Pattern
Creates seamless, repeating patterns like the Yellow Brick Road stretching to the horizon.

**Usage:**
```
Yellow brick road pattern with emerald accents --tile
```

##### 10. Stop Parameter (`--stop`) - Pausing Along the Journey
Controls when the image creation journey stops, like taking a rest along the Yellow Brick Road.

**Usage:**
```
The Tin Man in the forest --stop 80
```

**Journey Progress:**
* `10-100`: percentage of the Yellow Brick Road traveled before stopping

#### New V7 Features: The Ruby Slippers Upgraded

Midjourney's latest version 7 (released April 2025) includes some powerful new enchantments:

##### Draft Mode - The Wizard's Quick Sketch
Like the Wizard's initial illusions, Draft Mode creates images 10 times faster but with lower detail.

**Usage:**
```
Emerald City at sunset --v 7 --draft
```

You can then enhance these draft images with a simple click, just as the Wizard refined his illusions.

##### Personalization - Dorothy's Personal Journey
V7 includes a personalization system that learns your preferences, much like how Dorothy's journey became uniquely her own.

**Usage:**
First rate about 200 images to create your profile, then use your personalization code:
```
Munchkinland celebration --v 7 --p yourpersonalizationcode
```

#### Combining Parameters: Dorothy's Companions

Just as Dorothy was stronger with her companions, you can combine multiple parameters for more powerful results. Each parameter brings its unique strength, like the Scarecrow's brain, the Tin Man's heart, and the Lion's courage.

**Example:**
```
The four friends approaching the Emerald City --ar 16:9 --stylize 750 --chaos 30 --v 7 --q 2
```

#### Tips for Your Journey Through Oz

1. **Start in Kansas**: Begin with basic parameters before venturing into the more exotic ones
2. **Follow Different Paths**: Experiment by changing one parameter at a time
3. **Keep a Travel Journal**: Track successful parameter combinations for future adventures
4. **Balance Your Magic**: Very high chaos with very high stylization might create a tornado of unpredictability
5. **Know Your Realm**: Different versions respond differently to the same parameters, just as different parts of Oz have different rules

Understanding these parameters will significantly improve your ability to generate exactly the Oz-inspired images you want, whether you're using the Parameter Pattern or Template Pattern approach described in this guide. Remember, like Dorothy's journey, the real magic was within you all along—these parameters just help bring it out!
