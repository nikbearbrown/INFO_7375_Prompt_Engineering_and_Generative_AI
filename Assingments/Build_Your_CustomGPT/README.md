*Decoding AI, One Conversation at a Time*

## About
**Host: Nik Bear Brown, Associate Teaching Professor at Northeastern University**

Botspeak is a show-and-tell series about AI. I build interesting AI projects and show you exactly how they work. No curriculum, no predetermined pathâ€”just whatever AI concepts, tools, or techniques catch my interest.

## About Your Host
**Nik Bear Brown** - PhD Computer Science, Associate Teaching Professor at Northeastern University's College of Engineering. I've taught AI and machine learning for over a decade, led the AI4ED project, and collaborated with institutions like MIT's Broad Institute and Harvard Medical School.

## Format
